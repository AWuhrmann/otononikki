Web-app designed to be a second brain that fits my personal needs. I think other people might have the same needs so I made it open source.

The app supports the following things: 

## Habit tracker
The goal here is to make it as customizable as possible : 
- What type of information do you want to measure ? Steps done per day ? Time slept ? Money made ?
- Do you want to average it over a certain period ?
- How often do you want to record this information ?
- How do you want it to be displayed ?

You can download every statistics in csv files to pursue your own analysis

## Note taker 

I wanted to have an online note taker, which :
- Can support some AI productivity, such as automatic task detection and calendar update
- Easy voice recognition to make note taking super easy
- Synchronizable locally with Obsidian
- Able to understand some context about the notes to give meaningful information to remember

## Learning helper

I am a huge fan of Anki. I want to have support for Anki-like content, but as a all-in-one with the website. 
- Gamified (but not useless like many tools imo) way of learning, with original tasks (I hope I can make that)

## In a nuthsell

I want this website to really make my life easier and all in a flow. I want every interaction to feel effortless and suits my needs.
